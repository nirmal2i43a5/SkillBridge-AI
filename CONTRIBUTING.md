# Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt and set up a local virtual environment.
3. Run pytest and lint checks relevant to your changes.
4. Update documentation (README, docs/) when introducing new features or behaviour.
5. Submit a pull request summarising the motivation, implementation details, and testing evidence.

## Development Tips
- Use scripts/run_backend.py and scripts/run_frontend.py for local iteration.
- Keep functions pure where possible and add unit tests in 	ests/.
- Coordinate large refactors through GitHub issues to align on scope.
