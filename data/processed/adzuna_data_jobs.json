Why us? Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size) Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better) Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth About the opportunity: Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years \u2014 scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company\u2019s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies. Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible \u2013 insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc \u2013 a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we\u2019ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries. Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry: \"The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say \"key,\" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc). The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business. I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.\" How you will make an impact: Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency Preferred experience: Bachelor\u2019s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline 1+ years of experience from a top-tier economic consulting firm (Analysis Group, Cornerstone Research, Charles River Associates preferred) OR 1+ years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis High level of comfort with SQL or Python Who you are: You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company\u2019s C-suite You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence While we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.

Search Advanced Intermediate BI Developer \u276e back to last search Maxa AI Montreal, Quebec, H3B 2B6 $80-110k Full time Apply for this job TL;DR: BI Developer position in Montreal (hybrid from Tuesdays to Thursdays), Salary between $80-110K CAD Transform complex ERP data into business insights using our cutting-edge technology. MAXA is one of only 3 Snowflake Native Apps worldwide. Transform enterprise business analytics Maxa, an AI-first organization, is seeking an intermediate BI Developer to revolutionize how enterprises unlock their data potential. In this context, you will play a pivotal role in transforming raw business data into user-friendly visuals that drive executive decision-making. You'll also work to optimize internal processes and spread your knowledge within our BI team. At MAXA, we unlock the potential of enterprise data through our unique AI-first technology. Say goodbye to siloed analytics and disconnected business insights that fail to drive meaningful action. Our mission: automate the transformation of raw data into actionable financial, operational, and supply chain insights that empower executives to make confident decisions. The impact you'll make As a BI Developer, you'll be at the intersection of client success and technical implementation, architecting Power BI solutions that transform how enterprises make data-driven decisions. You'll have a direct, measurable impact on our clients' decision-making capabilities starting from your second week! You'll bridge the crucial gap between business challenges and AI-powered solutions by: Bringing your expertise to client kick-offs - Participating from day one in client engagements, identifying technical risks before they become roadblocks, and proposing innovative solutions that exceed expectations. Architecting robust data models - Building scalable Power BI solutions with advanced DAX, Power Query, and semantic modeling that handle enterprise-scale data from Snowflake and complex ERP systems. Delivering executive-ready insights - Creating compelling data stories that transform complex datasets into clear, user-friendly tools for C-level stakeholders across finance, operations, and supply chain. Driving technical excellence - Implementing CI/CD processes, security frameworks (RLS), and mentoring junior developers while establishing best practices that become company standards. You're the right fit if: You are familiar with Power BI's evolution - 2-3 years of hands-on Power BI experience, knowing its history from its early days to cutting-edge features like DAX Query View and TMDL. You're a pragmatic communicator - You can translate complex technical concepts into business value, raise red flags when needed, and educate cross-functional teams effectively. You speak fluent DAX and SQL - Intermdiate expertise in data modeling, Power Query (M code), and seamless integration with modern data platforms like Snowflake. You thrive in fast-paced environments - You're energized by 6-8 week project cycles, continuous learning, and the challenge of delivering first results within days, not months. You're bilingual and client-focused - Strong English and French communication skills with the ability to present confidently to executives and train end-users. This position is not for you if: You prefer working in isolation rather than collaborating with client-facing teams. You're resistant to continuous learning in a rapidly evolving tech ecosystem (Microsoft Fabric, Copilot, new Power BI features). You lack the humility to ask for help or share knowledge with team members. You're looking for a purely backend role without client interaction or business impact. What we offer $80-110K CAD base salary + stock options (Series A) Generous vacation: 4 weeks in first year, 5 weeks thereafter RRSP: 2% employer contribution after 3 months On-site chef: three course meals for just $12 Growth potential: Post Series A growth with direct impact on product roadmap What your integration will look like Join our BI Developer team under the leadership of Fabrice (BI Lead), who is passionate about continuous learning, technical excellence, and client success. From day one: Week 1: Jump into client support or new project assignments and explore our methodology Month 1: Lead your first client presentation and contribute to technical process improvements Month 3: Deliver critical assessments of our internal processes and implement optimization strategies that become team standards Your team dynamics: Weekly BI team meetings every Monday + active Slack collaboration Customer Delivery scrums Monday/Wednesday Philosophy: \"One foot in chaos, one foot in stability\" - embrace innovation while delivering excellence Recruitment process Initial screening with Marion (45 min, phone call) Technical interview with Fabrice (1 hour, technical deep-dive, in-person or remote) Leadership interview with Henri (1 hour, in-person) Apply now if you're ready to transform how businesses leverage data for performance improvement!
